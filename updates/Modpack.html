                            <h2>My Modpack</h2>
                            <p>As with many hobbies, years of doing the same activity the same way can become stale. And Mojang
                                isn't in the business of doing anything it seems as evidenced by their frequency of updates or lack
                                thereof.
                            </p>
                            <p>So, I decided to spice up my minecraft experience by searching for a modpack
                                to play. I explored modpacks such as '<em>Tekkit</em>', '<em>Feed The Beast</em>', and '<em>Enigmatica</em>'.
                                However, the sheer amount of content in the packs was too much for me to handle as a beginner in the modding
                                scene. All of those modpacks have over 100 mods and many of them use outdated versions of Minecraft. 
                            </p>
                            <p>I was looking for a much newer experience on 1.20 and with a much more beginner friendly experience. So, what better
                                way to get started than to make my own modpack that would suite my needs.
                            </p>
                            <p>My Modpack has 53 mods that are focused on automation, optimization, and new experiences that arent too overbearing.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Focus</h2>
                            <dl>
                                <dt>Automation</dt>
                                <dd>I wanted to focus on Automation as a big part of the game focuses around grinding for resources by hand. Which
                                    for someone who likes building such as me, is not something I want to dedicate several hours to. So I have included automation mods
                                    like '<em>The Thermal Series</em>', '<em>Applied Energisitcs 2</em>', and '<em>Computer Craft</em>'. Of course,
                                    These mods don't just automate for free so many mods that produce Redstone Flux like '<em>Immersive Engineering</em>' and 
                                    '<em>Extreme Reactors</em>' are included. 
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Optimization</dt>
                                <dd> Optimization should be a core focus when creating a modpack as Minecraft's rendering engine is very inefficient to say the least.
                                    I have included mods like '<em>Xenon</em>' and '<em>Oculus</em>' for better performance. The mod I am most impressed about is 
                                    '<em>Distant Horizons</em>' as it brings level of detail (LOD) to minecraft greatly increasing the perceived render distance.

                                </dd> 
                                <dt>Fresh New Experiences</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Bringing a fresh new experience to minecraft can be hard when faced with so many intriguing mods.
                                    So I decided to go with a few that vastly change the world generation including biomes and dungeons, but not to the point where you have no idea what's going on.
                                    I wanted to create an experience where the player is motivated to go out exploring, and had to go a slight distance to reach a new
                                    Dungeon or Cave. Rather than walking 10 blocks and seeing a new different dungeon or cave mod that gives you protection IV equivalent
                                    god armor, I wanted to have a balanced experience that can net you some diamonds or iron if you make it all the way through a series of
                                    spawner rooms. And that is exactly was '<em>Valhesia</em>' does. I have also included '<em>Biomes O' Plenty</em>' and '<em>Alex's Caves</em>' in
                                    order to change up the same old look of minecraft.
                                </dd>
